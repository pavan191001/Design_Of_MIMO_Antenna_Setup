1. S-parameters (or scattering parameters) are used to describe how energy can propagate through an electric network.S-Parameters are used 
   to describe the relationship between different ports, when it becomes especially important to describe a network in terms of amplitude 
   and phase versus frequencies, rather than voltages and currents.

2. VSWR (Voltage Standing Wave Ratio) is a measure of how efficiently radio-frequency power is transmitted from a power source, through 
   a transmission line, into a load

3. The radiation pattern or antenna pattern is the graphical representation of the radiation properties of the antenna as a function 
   of space. That is, the antenna's pattern describes how the antenna radiates energy out into space (or how it receives energy).
   
	3db beam width: Antenna 3dB Beam width is the angle between the half-power of an antenna pattern or beam over which the relative 
                   power is at or above 50% of the peak power. (angular width where relative power is at or above 50%).

  	beam width: Beamwidth is the angular separation at which the magnitude of the directivity pattern decreases by a certain value 
     from the peak of the main beam.

4. Gain(dbi): Gain (dBi) The ratio of the signal received or transmitted by a given antenna as compared to an isotropic or dipole antenna.

5. Current density (A/m^2): The amount of electric current traveling per unit cross-section area. Current densities are strongly affected 
   by the structure and the shape of antenna. 

	in comparing results, we can see decrease in current density in 2-1 antenna because as the structure and area of antenna is increased 
	which decrease the antenna current density.

6. Isotropic radiation is radiation that has the same intensity regardless of the direction of measurement.

7. Isotropic antenna: An isotropic antenna is defined as a hypothetical antenna having the same radiation in all directions 
    (i.e., uniform radiation).
